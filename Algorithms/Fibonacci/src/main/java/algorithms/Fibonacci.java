 * This class provides a (recursive) method to compute Fibonacci numbers using recursion.

 * Our feeling is that the time complexity of this method is not optimal.
 * 1) Do an analysis of the time complexity of this method in function of n
 * 2) Implement a more efficient method to compute Fibonacci numbers.
 *    Your method should have a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1).
 *
 * Your final method doesn't need to be recursive.
